# Mission to Mars

## Overview 

The goal of this project was to use a variety of tools to do an automated data scrape from multiple different websites to extract data about the "Mission to Mars". The scarped data was then stored in a NoSQL MongoDB, and then rendered in a web application that was created with Flask.

## Results

## Summary

In summary the final product was to deliver a fully-functional web application created with Flask that included images, a table with information about Mars in comparison to Earth, and the latest article title and short description scraped from the NASA's webpage. Each time we click on the "Scrape New Data" button new information will be updated on both the website and the MongoDB.
To wrap up this project we needed to also make this webpage mobile-responsive and add 2 additional Bootstrap 3 components to style the webpage.

### Two additional Bootstrap 3 components are used to style the webpage

1.	Changed the button color to Danger, which is red to blend with the background.
2.	Added a tooltip that says Click Me!, when the user hoovers over the Scrape button.
